## About
TimeyWimey allows you to ask stuff like<br />
`@TimeyWimey timefor @user`<br />
and<br />
`@TimeyWimey timeat 8PM @user`

First you need to set your timezone<br />
do that using **for example**<br />
`@TimeyWimey timezone europe/stockholm`<br />
or<br />
`@TimeyWimey timezone europe/stockholm 24h`<br />

## Have fun!
